1. Why list is used?
Ans: list is a dynamic array which contains elements of every datype like int, float, string, char, objects,
tuples which is the most important feature of list. It is mutable means once defined, it can change later.List
also provided with lots of inbuilt functions/methods. List contains duplicate elements too and it contains ordered
collection of elements.

2. How do list and sets differ?
Ans: 
i) List:
    - Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays which is collection of different elements
    - Lists are mutable
    - Lists contains duplicate elements
    - Lists are ordered collection of an elements
    - It is defined within square brackets []

ii) Sets:
    - Set is a unordered collection of an items
    - Set does not contain duplicate elements
    - Set is mutable
    - Set is defined within curly brackets {}

3. Applications of dictionaries in real world:
Ans: Dictionaries contain key-value pairs mapping format and internally maintained using hashing 
of which value can be retrived using key.
Few real world examples are:
    - Login id and Password
    - Username and Useraddress
    - DTEcode and College name
    - Rolllist and Studentname
